# Zookeeper Ensemble on OpenShift using StatefulSet
> ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed
> synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by
> distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and
> race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications
> initially usually skimp on them ,which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when
> done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are
> deployed.

Taken from the [Apache Zookeeper Project Page](http://zookeeper.apache.org). This project contains an OpenShift ready
deployment of Zookeeper.  

## Considerations
### Static Ensemble
The deployed ensemble consists out of three Zookeeper instances, which is statically defined. Using this deployment you
are able to specify a different number of instances, but a redeployment is required. A dynamic ensemble scaling isn't
supported as it is an alpha feature and Zookeeper doesn't recommend dynamic ensemble changes for production.

## Data and Data Log directory
TODO

## Monitoring
Configure your monitoring system to scrape all Zookeeper instances with an HTTP GET to
`http://<instance>:8080/commands/monitor`. The endpoint will return monitoring data in a Prometheus compatible format.
